Steps to run the project:-

Get your IP address by using command 'ipconfig' in terminal and copy the ipv4 address 
something like mine '192.168.1.8' and paste in the client.js file on line number 5.

1. Clone repository.

2. Open the cloned repo folder with VS code.

3. Ensure that main.js is running already.

3. Open terminal in VS code and type command   'node client.js'

4. And then Output.json file will be created in the project folder.

Refer Sample.json file which I have got by running project on my PC.
